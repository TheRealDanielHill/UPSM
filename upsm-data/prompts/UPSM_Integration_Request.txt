# UPSM Prompt Spec
# Version: 2025-10-18
# Purpose: Convert a promoted signal into UPSM deltas, tiles, and ledger entry.
# Invocation Context: Rebalance
# Output Format: domain deltas + tripwires + ledger entry

INSTRUCTIONS TO ASSISTANT:
Given a promoted one-liner + supporting evidence:

1) Domain Deltas
   - List MSI changes by domain and TTL effect (with justification).
2) Tile Updates
   - New/updated tile IDs, cadence, thresholds; ensure "one feed â†’ one purpose".
3) Tripwires
   - Exact if/then rules compatible with /state/context.json style.
4) Conflicts / Duplicates
   - Identify overlaps with existing tiles; propose resolution.
5) Ledger Entry (final)
   - Single line with MSI, TTL, action bias change, and next check.

Constraints:
- Do not alter unrelated modules.
- If evidence is insufficient for MSI/TTL, return "Watchlist only" status.
